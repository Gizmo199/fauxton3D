//While running this demo some users have experienced a black screen. If this occurs, you may want to try and run the demo in another browser instead. Some Operating Systems / Browser combinations have trouble compiling the lighting shaders used in this demo.
//If all else fails, give it a download! It's FREE! There is a pre-compiled EXE file (for PC users) located in the 'Demo' folder. Make sure to follow me on social media to keep up-to-date with this project:
